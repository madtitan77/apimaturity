The clients returned by the call to /api/apimaturity/clients* should be filtered by user:

- if the user has the role user 
--the clients with user_id (in clients table) equals to the user_id of the requesting user should be returned
--The system should also look into the  UserPermission table to find which clients the user has also access to. This will be indicated by and entry with the user_id and the client_id.
